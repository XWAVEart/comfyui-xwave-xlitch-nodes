### üé® Color Effects

#### XWAVE Noise Effect
Adds various types of noise to images with extensive customization options.

**Features:**
- 5 noise types: Film Grain, Digital, Colored, Salt & Pepper, Gaussian
- 4 blend modes: Overlay, Add, Multiply, Screen
- 3 patterns: Random, Perlin, Cellular
- Customizable grain size and color variation
- Seed control for reproducible results

**Inputs:**
- `image`: Input image
- `noise_type`: Type of noise effect
- `intensity`: Overall noise strength (0.0-1.0)
- `grain_size`: Size of noise particles (0.5-5.0)
- `color_variation`: Amount of color variation (0.0-1.0)
- `blend_mode`: How to blend noise with the image
- `pattern`: Noise generation pattern
- `noise_color`: Base color for colored noise (hex format)
- `seed`: Random seed (-1 for random)

## Usage Example

1. Add an image loader node
2. Find "XWAVE Noise Effect" under "XWAVE/Color" category
3. Connect image output to noise effect input
4. Adjust parameters to taste
5. Connect to preview or save node

## Workflow Examples

Example workflows can be found in the `examples/` directory.

## Tips for Best Results

### Noise Effect Tips:
- **Film Grain**: Use low intensity (0.1-0.3) for realistic film look
- **Digital Noise**: Works well with higher intensities
- **Pattern Selection**:
  - `random`: Classic noise
  - `perlin`: Organic, cloud-like patterns
  - `cellular`: Unique structured patterns
- **Blend Modes**:
  - `overlay`: Preserves image details
  - `add`: Brightens the image
  - `multiply`: Creates texture effects
  - `screen`: Lighter, ethereal effect

## Coming Soon

- **Color Manipulation**: Channel swapping, histogram effects, color filters
- **Pixel Sorting**: Advanced sorting algorithms with multiple modes
- **Distortion Effects**: Wave, ripple, and displacement effects
- **Glitch Effects**: Databending, bit manipulation, corruption effects
- **Pattern Generation**: Voronoi, concentric shapes, masked merges
- **And many more!**
