- `seed`: Random seed (-1 for random, currently unused)

#### XWAVE RGB Channel Shift
Creates chromatic aberration effects by shifting or mirroring RGB channels independently.

**Features:**
- 2 modes: Shift channels spatially or mirror them
- Control which channel stays centered
- Adjustable shift amount
- Horizontal or vertical shifting
- Perfect for glitch aesthetics and retro effects

**Inputs:**
- `image`: Input image
- `mode`: Operation mode (shift or mirror)
- `shift_amount`: Number of pixels to shift (1-100, ignored in mirror mode)
- `direction`: Shift direction (horizontal or vertical)
- `centered_channel`: Which channel remains unchanged (R, G, or B)

#### XWAVE Histogram Glitch
Apply different mathematical transformations to each color channel independently.

**Features:**
- 4 transformation modes per channel: Solarize, Log, Gamma, Normal
- Independent control for R, G, B channels
- Solarization with frequency and phase control
- Gamma correction with adjustable power
- Logarithmic compression for dynamic range control

**Inputs:**
- `image`: Input image
- `r_mode`, `g_mode`, `b_mode`: Transformation mode for each channel
- `r_freq`, `g_freq`, `b_freq`: Solarization frequency (0.1-10.0)
- `r_phase`, `g_phase`, `b_phase`: Solarization phase (0.0-6.28)
- `gamma_val`: Gamma value for gamma transformation (0.1-3.0)

### üé≠ Pixelation Effects

#### XWAVE Pixelate
Applies traditional pixelation with attribute-based color selection.

**Features:**
- Customizable pixel block dimensions
- Multiple attribute modes for pixel selection
- Preserves important visual characteristics based on chosen attribute

**Inputs:**
- `image`: Input image
- `pixel_width`: Width of each pixelated block (1-256)
- `pixel_height`: Height of each pixelated block (1-256)
- `attribute`: Attribute to use for pixel grouping:
  - `color`: Most common color in each block
  - `brightness`: Average brightness-based selection
  - `hue`: Hue-based pixel selection
  - `saturation`: Saturation-based selection
  - `luminance`: Luminance-based selection

## Usage Example

1. Add an image loader node
2. Find "XWAVE Noise Effect" under "XWAVE/Color" category
3. Connect image output to noise effect input
4. Adjust parameters to taste
5. Connect to preview or save node

## Workflow Examples

Example workflows can be found in the `examples/` directory.

## Tips for Best Results

### Noise Effect Tips:
- **Film Grain**: Use low intensity (0.1-0.3) for realistic film look
- **Digital Noise**: Works well with higher intensities
- **Pattern Selection**:
  - `random`: Classic noise
  - `perlin`: Organic, cloud-like patterns
  - `cellular`: Unique structured patterns
- **Blend Modes**:
  - `overlay`: Preserves image details
  - `add`: Brightens the image
  - `multiply`: Creates texture effects
  - `screen`: Lighter, ethereal effect

### Color Channel Manipulation Tips:
- **Swap**: Create interesting color shifts by swapping channels
  - `RG`: Swap red and green for surreal landscapes
  - `RB`: Swap red and blue for dramatic effects
  - `GB`: Swap green and blue for unique tones
- **Invert**: Invert individual channels for artistic effects
  - Inverting single channels creates unique color palettes
- **Adjust**: Fine-tune channel intensity
  - Values < 1.0 reduce channel intensity
  - Values > 1.0 boost channel intensity
- **Negative**: Creates a full color negative effect

### RGB Channel Shift Tips:
- **Shift Mode**: Creates chromatic aberration effects
  - Small shifts (5-15): Subtle color fringing
  - Medium shifts (20-40): Noticeable channel separation
  - Large shifts (50+): Extreme glitch effects
- **Mirror Mode**: Creates symmetrical channel effects
  - Each non-centered channel is mirrored differently
  - Creates unique artistic distortions
- **Centered Channel**: Choose which color dominates
  - `R`: Red stays centered, green/blue shift
  - `G`: Green stays centered, red/blue shift  
  - `B`: Blue stays centered, red/green shift
- **Direction**: Changes the axis of the effect
  - `horizontal`: Left/right shifts or mirroring
  - `vertical`: Up/down shifts or mirroring

### Histogram Glitch Tips:
- **Solarize**: Creates wave-like transformations
  - Low frequency (0.1-2.0): Smooth transitions
  - High frequency (5.0-10.0): Rapid inversions
  - Phase shifts the wave pattern
- **Log Transform**: Compresses bright areas
  - Useful for high dynamic range images
  - Creates film-like tonal curves
- **Gamma Transform**: Power-based adjustments
  - < 1.0: Brightens mid-tones
  - > 1.0: Darkens mid-tones
  - 1.0: No change
- **Mix and Match**: Try different modes on each channel
  - Solarize red, log green, gamma blue for unique effects
  - Use normal mode to keep a channel unchanged

## Coming Soon

- **Color Manipulation**: Channel swapping, histogram effects, color filters
- **Pixel Sorting**: Advanced sorting algorithms with multiple modes
- **Distortion Effects**: Wave, ripple, and displacement effects
- **Glitch Effects**: Databending, bit manipulation, corruption effects
- **Pattern Generation**: Voronoi, concentric shapes, masked merges
- **And many more!**
